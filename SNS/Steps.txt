There are 4 places:

1)Laptop since there was no 

keygen 
2)Host
3)Server
4)Client

Step 1 :
Laptop 

To check if this folder exists or not
$ cd ~/.ssh

If not then create the using key 
$ ssh-keygen

If the key is already there then it will ask

Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/c/Users/Abhinav Kumar/.ssh/id_rsa):
/c/Users/Abhinav Kumar/.ssh/id_rsa already exists.
Overwrite (y/n)? n


If you will say y then it will override the old key else it will not generate the 


The key will generate two keys one public key and another is the private key


While creating the key generation it will ask for setting up the password. We kept empty otherwise it will keep asking for the password 
even for simple cmd commands 

To connect with the VM
type ssn username@severhost
UserName is the remote server computer you are tryting to connect to and not the local computer 

We always provide the public key to the remote server 
ssh-copy-id root@ip address

The sever has your public key 

Now we can connect to the server using username@severhost and this time it will connect to the server directory and will ask for the 
password only if we have given any password while creating ssn key


To copy the file from the local to the server 

scp short for secure copy 

Step 1 : Go to the folder in local computer where the file is present
index.html
Step 2 : 

scp index.html username@severhost:/file path
 this file path can be provided like 
 


pwd - present working directory

vi authorized_keys to open the file

escape+ :q! quit file without saving changes
escape+ :wq save

cat or echo to see

1) On your local machine, start ssh agent

                                eval $(ssh-agent -s)

2) Add your private key into ssh agent list

                             ssh-add ~/.ssh/yourPrivateKeyName

3) Use forward agent to ssh into your host

                             ssh -o ForwardAgent=yes yourUserName@YourIpAddress

4) ssh into your client or server VM

                                ssh sadmin@192.168.122.183

                                                or

                                ssh cadmin@192.168.122.188

(Now save) :wq

Now run the command
